## Purpose
Being a tracker, Renoise keeps notes quantized to a grid (16th notes by default). To place notes off of that grid (e.g. to create a strum), Delay values must be tediously typed for each note. *Reform* performs granular 2D transformations on selections of notes, so that unquantized MIDI sequences can be made in a matter of seconds, instead of minutes.
